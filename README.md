commentcava
===========

what is commentcava?
-------------

commentçava is a multi-level comment system that can work in javascript for static websites (ie. Jekyll).
It allows anonymous posting. Comments can shown a username and a url to a website in addition to the message.
By default on the php server script, I uses a PDO SQlite database.
To avoid flood, there is a captcha.
It should work with multiple domains (crossdomains) too, but i haven't tested it.

SQlite database
-------------
SQlite database can be created with the install php script.

How to use it?
-------------
Look at the examples, they're quite easy to understand :)
Feel free to ask if you're stuck.

Styling
-------------
commentcava provides a default css, but if you don't like it, make another one :).

Why create commentcava?
-------------

I started it for a friend (Schoewilliam) back in 2011, then told me i could reuse it.
I created it so it is the simplest possible, sticks to 2 methods: 1) retrieve comments 2) post comments
For security i added a captcha on the form to post a comment.
I know some alternatives exists on the web, like jskomment, but i consider it is overkill to use it.

BONUS: what does commentcava means and how to pronounce?
-------------

the french «Comment ça va?» is the equivalent of the english «How are you?»
I found this fun when searching for a name containing "comment".
